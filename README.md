#RSpec Demo

I'm using this app to experiment with various testing methods for Ruby on Rails using RSpec. Additional gems thus
far are Factory Girl, Capybara, Launchy, Faker, and some RSpec add-ons. I'm following the tutorials in Instant RSpec 
Test-Driven Development How-to at the moment. Eventually, I will have tests for the functionality of my other 
repositories, which use 'dropbox-sdk', 'wicked_pdf', 'rubyzoho', 'cocoon', etc.

#Installation

All you need to do is git clone the repository and run bundle install.
